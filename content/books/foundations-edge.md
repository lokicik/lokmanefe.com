## About This Book

Foundation's Edge is the fourth novel in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, winner of the Hugo Award for Best Novel. At last, the costly and bitter war between the two Foundations has come to an end. The scientists of the First Foundation have proved victorious, and now they return to Hari Seldon's long-established plan to build a new Empire on the ruins of the old.

But rumors persist that the Second Foundation is not destroyed after all—and that its still-defiant survivors are preparing their revenge. Now two exiled citizens of the Foundation—a renegade Councilman and the doddering historian who first exposed the Second Foundation's menace—set out in search of the deadliest enemy humankind has ever faced.

Meanwhile, someone—or something—outside of both Foundations seems to be orchestrating events to suit its own ominous purpose. Soon representatives of both the First and Second Foundations will find themselves racing toward a mysterious world called Gaia and a final, shocking destiny at the very end of the universe.
