## About This Book

The bestselling Robot series continues in this sequel to The Caves of Steel, with detective Elijah Baley taking on the dangerous role of double agent when he’s sent to Solaria to solve a brutal murder—and uncover a weakness in Earth’s most powerful neighbor. “With his fertile imagination, his wit, and his prolific output, Isaac Asimov truly laid the foundation for all future generations of science fiction writers.”—Kevin J. Anderson, New York Times bestselling co-author of the Dune prequel series On the beautiful Outer World planet of Solaria, a handful of human colonists lead a hermit-like existence, their every need attended to by their faithful robot servants. To this strange and provocative planet comes Detective Elijah Baley, sent from the streets of New York with his positronic partner, the robot R. Daneel Olivaw, to solve an incredible murder that has rocked Solaria to its foundations. The victim had been so reclusive that he appeared to his associates only through holographic projection. Yet someone had gotten close enough to bludgeon him to death while robots looked on. Now Baley and Olivaw are faced with two clear impossibilities: Either the Solarian was killed by one of his robots—unthinkable under the laws of Robotics—or he was killed by the woman who loved him so much that she never came into his presence! Isaac Asimov’s Robot series chronicles the sometimes uneasy partnership between human and humanoid: I, ROBOT • THE CAVES OF STEEL • THE NAKED SUN • THE ROBOTS OF DAWN
