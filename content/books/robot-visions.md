## About This Book

"New edition of this classic collection of Asimov's robot tales. From Robbie (hero of the first robot story Asimov wrote at the age of nineteen) to the tales of Susan Calvin, first robot psychologist, and the human and robot detectives Lije Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw, here are key moments in the fictional history of human-robot relations."
