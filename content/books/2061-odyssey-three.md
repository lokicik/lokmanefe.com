## About This Book

2061 is the year Halley's Comet makes its next pilgrimage to the inner Solar System - and the year centenarian Heywood Floyd encounters once again the alien Monoliths. Near Jupiter, the transfigured forms of Dave Bowman and HAL the computer are Heywood's only chance of survival - if they too are not now alien beings.

## My Take
