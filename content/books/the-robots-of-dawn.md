## About This Book

In this thrilling entry in the renowned Robot series, interplanetary detective Elijah Baley embarks on a mind-stretching journey after the universe’s most advanced robot is found murdered. “With his fertile imagination, his wit, and his prolific output, Isaac Asimov truly laid the foundation for all future generations of science fiction writers.”—Kevin J. Anderson, New York Times bestselling co-author of the Dune prequel series Detective Elijah Baiey is called to the Spacer world Aurora to solve a bizarre case of roboticide. The prime suspect is a gifted roboticist who had the means, the motive, and the opportunity to commit the crime. There’s only one catch: Baley and his positronic partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, must prove the man innocent. For in a case of political intrigue and love between woman and robot gone tragically wrong, there’s more at stake than simple justice. This time Baley’s career, his life, and Earth’s right to pioneer the Galaxy lie in the delicate balance. Isaac Asimov’s Robot series chronicles the sometimes uneasy partnership between human and humanoid: I, ROBOT • THE CAVES OF STEEL • THE NAKED SUN • THE ROBOTS OF DAWN
